## 4. Architecture Overview  

### **High-Level Design**  
The app uses an **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and ease of testing.  

```plaintext
[UI Layer]
   |
   --> View (Fragments & Activities)  
   |
   --> ViewModel  
   |
   --> Model (Repository + Database)
```

### **Low-Level Design**  
**Modules:**  
1. **MainActivity:** Handles navigation and permissions.  
2. **Database:** Manages user and contact data.  
3. **Fragments:** Implements individual UI components (e.g., Home, Maps).

## 6. Code Walkthrough  

### **MainActivity**  

Handles permissions, navigation, and fragment transactions.  

```kotlin  
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private val permissions = arrayOf(
        android.Manifest.permission.INTERNET,
        android.Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
    )
    private val requestCode = 100

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        // Inflate the layout and check permissions
    }

    private fun checkAndRequestPermissions() {
        // Request necessary permissions
    }
}
```  

### **Room Database Implementation**  

Manages CRUD operations for contacts.  

```kotlin  
@Dao
interface ContactDao {
    @Insert
    suspend fun insertContact(contact: ContactModel)

    @Query("SELECT * FROM contactList")
    suspend fun getAllContacts(): List<ContactModel>
}
```
